## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- OpenAI API key

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RonelWA/Financial-Market-Analysis.git
    cd Financial-Market-Analysis
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up your OpenAI API key:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        ```

## Usage

### Running the Application
1. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

### Home Page
The home page provides an introduction to the platform and a "Get Started" button.

### Prediction Page
- Enter the name of the mobile phone you want to predict the price for.
- The application will display the predicted price, a confidence interval, similar phones, and an image generated by DALL-E.

## Features
- Predicts the price of a smartphone based on its features.
- Provides a confidence interval for the predicted price.
- Suggests similar phones based on their RAM and storage features.
- Generates an image of the phone with its specifications using OpenAI's DALL-E model.
- Autocomplete feature for phone names.

## Model Details
The application uses a stacking regressor model to predict the price of a phone. The model is trained using various features such as RAM, storage, display size, and resolution. The stacking model combines multiple regression models to improve prediction accuracy.

### Training the Model
The model is trained using the data in `Mobile-Phones.csv`. The training process is documented in the Jupyter notebook `PriceMyPhone.ipynb`.

### Features Used
- RAM (in GB)
- Storage (in GB)
- Display size (in inches)
- Resolution (in pixels)
