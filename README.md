## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pricemyphonegh.git
    cd pricemyphonegh
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```


## Running the Application

1. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

## Usage

- **Home Page:**
  - The home page provides an introduction to the platform and a "Get Started" button.

- **Prediction Page:**
  - Enter the name of the mobile phone you want to predict the price for.
  - The application will display the predicted price, a confidence interval, similar phones, and an image generated by DALL-E.

## Autocomplete Feature

The application supports an autocomplete feature for phone names. Start typing the name of the phone in the input field, and you will see suggestions based on the available phone models.

## Disclaimer

Images of phones generated by DALL-E may differ slightly due to copyright and selling legalities.

## Logging

The application logs its activities to `app.log`. Check this file for detailed logs and debugging information.



## Machine Learning Model

### Data Preparation

- **Data Loading**:
    - Load the data from a CSV file using `pandas`.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Imputation**:
    - Handle missing values by filling numerical columns with their median and categorical columns with their mode.

- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Combine `brand` and `model` into a single column `brand_model`.
    - Encode categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Compute the correlation matrix to identify the most relevant features for predicting the price.

- **Feature Visualization**:
    - Visualize the distribution of key numerical features using histograms and boxplots.

- **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Train and evaluate multiple models: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor.
    - Use `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.

- **Neural Network Model**:
    - Train a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

- **Stacking Regressor**:
    - Combine the predictions of multiple models using a stacking regressor to improve performance.

### Feature Importance

- **SHAP Values**:
    - Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the feature importance of the trained Random Forest model.

### Model Persistence

- **Save the Model and Features**:
    - Save the trained model and the features used during training using `joblib`.
